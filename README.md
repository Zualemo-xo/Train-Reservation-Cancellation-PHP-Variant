A robust login,menu ,date selection,booking and cancellation page have been developed using HTML, CSS and PHP.Suitable form validation has been provided using PHP in each of these modules.The database and tables used are with MYSQL as attached below.Sessions play a major role to track the user-id ,to both display it and to use it to store and retrieve contents from the database.Sessions are also used to send date and boarding information that the user enters to the next page for further use.

This scenario is from October 20th to October 24th for 10 trains ,with classes A1, 3 Tier AC,2 Tier AC and Sleeper corresponding to 10 tickets each-with a feature to avoid overbooking.Cancellation also ensures that only the user who booked the ticket can cancel it and that too only once with the help of sessions.
